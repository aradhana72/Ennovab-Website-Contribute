### Event - Introduction to FOSS<br>
### Contribute to the Ennovab website. <br>

**Ennovab** presents before you **"Introduction to FOSS Hacktoberfest 2020"** â€” brought to you by DigitalOcean in partnership with Dev & Intel â€” is a month-long celebration of open-source software. The event promises an exhilarating ride to boost anyone's interest in open-source.
1. Get started with open-source with your first pull request.
2. Became more comfortable with Git on GitHub and through the CLI.
3. Interact with developers and open-source contributors.

No contribution is too small â€” bug fixes and documentation updates are valid ways of participating. 

**Warnning:** You can only contribute to this repo if you have registered for the event **'Introduction to FOSS'** and joined the **'Ennovab' Discord Server**
